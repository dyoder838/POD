## Description
        
PODS is an app that creates a community of support for home-schooled children during the pandemic. 
Parents and Children are now both working from home. Children still need hands on help that a virtual classroom cannot provide. Some parents cannot provide that support and do their jobs at the same time.
Parents can use PODS to create or join a small group (POD) for their child to attend. 

For example: I am a parent of a school aged child who is attending school via Zoom from home. I am also attending work via Zoom at the same time, I cant leave my meeting to assist my child when their needs arise. 
I know my child has classmates in our apartment complex - wouldn't it be great if my child could go to their apartment for school! But I don't know who is available and if their parent would be willing to help. 
PODS is the social network that solves that problem by allowing parents to volunteer their availability, and connect it to other parents with needs. 

The current release is early access and has plenty of room for growth.
